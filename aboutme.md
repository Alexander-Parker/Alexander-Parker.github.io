I am an investment banker turned data scientist and programmer. I most recently completed Metis, a 12-week immersive data science bootcamp, where I worked on machine learning projects (some of which are on this blog). Prior to Metis, I worked as an investment banking analyst at Jefferies in their oil and gas group where we focused on domestic upstream M&A. 

I developed a love for programming and data science through college organizations like a student-run algorithmic trading fund and by working on personal projects such as a chat bot designed to mimic my friends. I believe my background in finance and banking lends me a unique perspective of the business problems data scientists are often trying to solve, but I am excited to constantly sharpen my statistics, machine learning and programming chops!
